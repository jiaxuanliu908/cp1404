1.regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks,
how was your accuracy and did your accuracy 
improve during the course of the subject?

In the course of the tasks, I have learned a lot about 
grammar and equations, such as structural issues. 
At the end of each task, the teacher would provide
detailed feedback to help me improve accuracy.

2.regarding code reviews, what have you 
learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?

Code reviews have taught me the importance of 
adhering to coding standards and best practices 
and can effectively improve the quality of my code.

3.regarding the practical tasks overall, 
what would you change if you were in charge 
of the subject?

My suggestion is to add comments sparingly
to make it easier for readers to understand.
